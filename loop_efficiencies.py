"""
The extra checks (such as if i < n: pass lines) in the for lopps with increments, or tests, or increments and tests slowed down the computation.
The verdict is that in the looping methods the pure for loop was the most efficient. 
All methods considered, the non loops are faster than for loops. Amongst the three non loop methods pure math was the best! 
The second and third fastest are the numpy sum and sum range respectively. 
The reason numpy sum is faster than sum range is due to the fact that numpy is written in C whereas sum range is using python functions.
C is faster than python. 
Back to the ultimate winner--the pure math (sum_math) implementation is the way to go in the future.
