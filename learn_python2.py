Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.
    Clases ...
        are used to create user-defined data structures. 
        define functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.
    Instancce...
        is an object that is built from a class and contains real data.
    Classes and Objects
        Python is an object oriented programming language.
        Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
        A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
    Inheritance...
        Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.   
        Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
        Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
        
Multithreading can run multiple tasks in parallel to speed up our scripts.

Thread synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent threads do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as critical section. 
    Critical section refers to the parts of the program where the shared resource is accessed.
    
socket is ...
    one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 
    bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
    
Recursion: a function calling itself.

################################################# Multithreading
"""
In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Any process has 3 basic components:
    An executable program.
    The associated data needed by the program (variables, work space, buffers, etc.)
    The execution context of the program (State of process)
A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. Also, it is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS (Operating System).
In simple words, a thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. 
For simplicity, you can assume that a thread is simply a subset of a process!

Multithreading can run multiple tasks in parallel to speed up our scripts.

The pros of multithreading:
    Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently
    Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.
    Threads sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes.
    
Non threading: do task 1 then do task 2.
multithreading: do task 1 and task 2.

################################################# Queues
"""
queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. 
With a queue the least recently added item is removed first.

Helps to manage threads.

A FIFO queue is a queue that operates on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. 
This means that the request (like a customer in a store or a print job sent to a printer) is processed in the order in which it arrives. 
A first-come, first-served line is the most common type of queue that we join in our everyday lives and is generally accepted as the fairest way to operate a queue.
In queuing theory, the rule governing queue operation is known as queuing discipline. 
Besides first-in-first-out, other queuing disciplines include last-in-first-out, prioritized, and serve-in-random-order.  
The online queues in Queue-it’s virtual waiting room are based on the first-in, first-out queuing discipline.

socket is ...
    one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. 
    bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data.

IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods. 
    IP addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers — an example address might be 192.158.1.38. 
    Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. 
    So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.
    
Port is a number used to uniquely identify a transaction over a network by specifying both the host, and the service. 
    They are necessary to differentiate between many different IP services, such as web service (HTTP), mail service (SMTP), and file transfer (FTP).

Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. 
The software’s developer adds logging calls to their code to indicate that certain events have occurred. 
An event is described by a descriptive message which can optionally contain variable data (i.e. data that is potentially different for each occurrence of the event). 
Events also have an importance which the developer ascribes to the event; the importance can also be called the level or severity.

Application developers and IT organizations are free to customize log levels and categorize log events according to their own specific needs. 
For applications that log events based on the Syslog standard, there are 8 different log levels that can be used to categorize a log according to its severity:
Eight security levels
    - emergency: given the numerical value "0". This category is assigned when an event log indicates that the system is completely unusable.
    - alert: given the numerical value "1". This category is assigned when an event log requires an immediate response, such as when a system database becomes corrupted and must be restored to prevent the loss of critical data or services.
    - critical: given the numerical value "2". This category is assigned for critical errors, such as hardware failure.
    - error: given the numerical value "3". This category is assigned to event logs that contain an application error message.
    - warning: given the numerical value "4". Error conditions happen when an operation fails, while a warning might indicate that an operation will fail in the future if action is not taken now.
    - notice: given the numerical value "5". They include information about events that may be unusual but are not errors.
    - informational: given the numerical value "6". They include information about successful operations within the application, such as a successful start, pause, or exit of the application.
    - debug: given the numerical value "7". These logs typically contain information that is only useful during the debug phase and may be of little value during production.
